# 81pythonprojects
As I learn Python, I will be using the Big Book of Small Python Projects: 81 Easy Practice Programs by Al Sweigart.

The code in each progrma will be mostly similar to the programs featured in teh Big Book of Small Python Projects, with the main differences being in my variable names or in the comments. Each comment is made for the sake of my own understanding and will thus vary. 

This README file explains each project in the repository and some of my takeaways from each program. 

I will do my best to update this repository or, in other words, create a new project or two, every week.
